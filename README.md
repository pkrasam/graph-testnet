# the-graph-testnet

Recently along with many other talented and capable web3 engineers and validators, I was invited to participate in the `MISSION CONTROL` ...a 5 phase testnet of the Graph Protocol

There are a lot of moving pieces to making this technology work.

I chose this method of creating a github repository, a place to document my findings, research, best practices, tooling, scripts, and anything else that is required for this journey.
